## How we play matches
1. Once you sign up, it is your responsibility to get a sub if you cannot play.<br>
2. The captain is responsible for getting players if there are less than four. (Subs)<br>
3. When requesting a sub, email the group including your name, who is playing, and your needs. Once a sub is found, email everyone with the sub's name. You also need to edit the request with the replacement in Chelsea. If you can be the sub, use “reply” and not “reply all” to the Captain.<br>
4. If you know someone interested in playing in the group, we need two references. If they don’t know anyone else they can start as a sub.<br>
5. You must use the email on the roster to sign up. If you change your email please let me know. ALL UNKNOWN EMAIL REQUESTS WILL BE DELETED.<br>
