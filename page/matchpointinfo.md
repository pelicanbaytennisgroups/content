## Why join MATCHPOINT<br>
Need a paragraph that let's potential players know if MatchPoint is a good fit for them.
## [Email the group co-ordinator](mailto:m.bowman@yahoo.com)<br>
Contact the group coordinator to apply or get more information on MatchPoint
## When do we play -- 8:00 AM at North courts is preferred<br>
1. Monday to Saturday, year-round<br>
2. Captains create court REQUESTs through Chelsea<br>
3. Specify court preferance as **North/South/Any**,<br>
   Time preference as Requested: **8:00 AM**,  Earliest **8:00 AM**, Latest **11:00**<br>
 4. During high demand periods, Chelsea will schedule available times and courts between the Earliest and Latest time
 5. If no courts are available, you need to be BOOK any available court to play. 
## How we play matches
1. Once you sign up, it is your responsibility to get a sub if you cannot play.<br>
2. The captain is responsible for getting players if there are less than four. (Subs)<br>
3. When requesting a sub, email the group including your name, who is playing, and your needs. Once a sub is found, email everyone with the sub's name. You also need to edit the request with the replacement in Chelsea. If you can be the sub, use “reply” and not “reply all” to the Captain.<br>
4. If you know someone interested in playing in the group, we need two references. If they don’t know anyone else they can start as a sub.<br>
## Signing up for to play with you unique email address.
1. We schedule matches for one month at a time.  You can sign up (electronic form) during the prior month.
3. Your email on the group roster is your default, unique ID for signing up for dates with the form. There is no password needed to signup.
4. There is only one email per player on the roster.
5. If you wish to change your default email ID, please contact the group coordinator to make the change.
6. If you use an email address, not on the roster, and it cannot be verified as belonging to you, YOUR REQUESTED DATES MAY BE IGNORED AND YOU WILL NOT BE SCHEDULED.
7. When you fill out the signup form, if you do not receive an confirmation email within 60 seconds, you entered an invalid email (typo) and you should enter you dates again with the correct email address.
## Publishing the Schedule of Matches
1. The schedule of matches for the next month is published on the Member page the day after signup ends
2. The current month and the prior monthe schedules are alway available on the Member page
3.  For example, signup for the month of April typically ends about March 24 (dates vary slightly each month). The April schedule is published the next day, on March 25. This gives captains time to create the court requests for April 1 matches. 
## Entering court requests in Chelsea
Court request need to be entered in Chelsea 3 days before the match date, for example, if a match on April 6, needs to be entered no later than April 2. Chelsea issue court assignment - by email - 3 days prior to the match, on April 3.
## Requesting courts if you're the Captain.
1. Login to Chelsea and create a court REQUEST at least 4 days prior to the date of the match <br>
2. Enter Court Time Info.We play Monday- Saturday 8 am North 8:00 AM North/South/Any. 11 a.m. is the latest time to put.<br>
3. Enter Player Info and Submit.<br>
   Type the first few letters of the players last nanme and select from the list.  You do not need the Pelican Bay ID.<br>
4. **For each match, the Captain supplies new clay court balls.** If you are the Captain and need to sub out of a match, you still are responsible for supplying the match balls.<br>
5. Make a buddy list and save all players in it
## Google Group EMAIL list:
1. Your default roster email will be added to the MatchPoint Google Group: matchpoint-tennis@googlegroups.com
2. Check your spam and mark @googlegroups as a safe sender. Create a contact in your addressb book. This ensures that your mail spam filter will not block group emails.<br>
3. The group email allows you to send emails to all members of the MatchPoint tennis group when you address and email to matchpoint-tennis@googlegroups.com.<br>
4. Reply directly to the sender when agreeing to sub to prevent flooding everyone with unnecessary emails.

If you feel the need to contact people, please use the Roster and send individual emails. If any other unrelated emails are sent, you may be subject to being removed from the group<br>
