## How we play matches
1. Once you sign up, it is your responsibility to get a sub if you cannot play.<br>
2. The captain is responsible for getting players if there are less than four. (Subs)<br>
3. When requesting a sub, email the group including your name, who is playing, and your needs. Once a sub is found, email everyone with the sub's name. You also need to edit the request with the replacement in Chelsea. If you can be the sub, use “reply” and not “reply all” to the Captain.<br>
4. If you know someone interested in playing in the group, we need two references. If they don’t know anyone else they can start as a sub.<br>
## Signing up for to play and getting out the schedule
1. We schedule matches for one month at a time.  You can sign up (electronic form) during the prior month.
2. For example, Signup for April play between February 24 and March 24.  The April schedule is published on March 25. This gives captains about 3 days to enter the court request for the first matches of the month.
5. You must use the email on the roster to sign up or your requested may not be recognized and you may not be scheduled to play.  If you are unsure of which email you signed up with, requested a roster or call the group coordinator.<br>
