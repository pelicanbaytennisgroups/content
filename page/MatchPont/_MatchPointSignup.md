**Current Month Pairings Report**

insert a link for the march-2025-pairings-pdf here


First, place the PDF into the `page/pdfs` directory.
Then, you can use the format below, replacing the file name to match your pairings.
I'ts very important to ensure the path starts with `../pdfs/` :

embed-pdf url="../../pdfs/march-2025-matchpoint-pairings.pdf" renderPageNum="1"


You can do the same with images by placing them into the `/page/content-images` directory.
