This folder (`page`) is where you can create a new post. Each `.md` document corresponds to a new post automatically.

Here's how you can embed a PDF:

- First, place the PDF into the `page/pdfs` directory. Then, you can use the format below, replacing the file name to match your pairings. ensure the path starts with `../pdfs/` :
`{{< embed-pdf url="../pdfs/march-2025-matchpoint-pairings.pdf" renderPageNum="1" >}}`

{{< embed-pdf url="../pdfs/march-2025-matchpoint-pairings.pdf" renderPageNum="1" >}}
