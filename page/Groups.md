# Overview of Pelican Bay Tennis Groups

## Finding a tennis group at Pelican Bay

> There are many social groups organized for weekly play<br>
Groups may schedule matches for the all or part of the winter season<br>
Some groups schedule matches year-round<br>
Groups are privately organized by Pelican Bay residents and are not a service of the Pelican Bay Foundation<br>
Many players belong to two or more groups depending on their skill and day/times they want to play<br>

Groups may ...

1. Require a specific level of skill to insure fun and competitive play
2. Limit total membership
