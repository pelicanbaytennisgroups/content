## When do we play -- 8:00 AM at North courts

2. Captains create court REQUESTs through Chelsea
3. Specify court preferance as **North/South/Any**,
   Time preference as Requested: **8:00 AM**,  Earliest **8:00 AM**, Latest **11:00**
4. During high demand periods, Chelsea schedules courts on a best available basis
5. If no courts are available, you need to be BOOK any available court to play.

## We match you with players of similar skill
1. Our objective is that matches are fun and competitive for everyone.
2. When ever possible, we match players of similar skills.
3. Discuss your skills with the Coordinator at any time to adjust your level of competition.

## How we play matches

1. Once you sign up, it is your responsibility to get a sub if you cannot play.
2. The captain is responsible for getting players if there are less than four. (Subs)
3. When requesting a sub, email the group including your name, who is playing, and your needs. Once a sub is found, email everyone with the sub's name. You also need to edit the request with the replacement in Chelsea. If you can be the sub, use “reply” and not “reply all” to the Captain.
4. If you know someone interested in playing in the group, we need two references. If they don’t know anyone else they can start as a sub.

## Signing up for to play with your unique email address

1. We publish a schedule of matches for one month at a time.  You sign up (electronic form) during the prior month.
3. Your email on the group roster is your default, unique ID for signing up for dates with the form. There is no password needed to signup.
4. There is only one email per player on the roster.
5. If you wish to change your default email ID, please contact the group coordinator to make the change.
6. If you use an email address, not on the roster, and it cannot be verified as belonging to you, YOUR REQUESTED DATES MAY BE IGNORED AND YOU WILL NOT BE SCHEDULED.
7. When you fill out the signup form, if you do not receive an confirmation email within 60 seconds, you entered an invalid email (probably with a typo) and you should enter you dates again with the correct email address.

## Publishing the Schedule of Matches

1. MatchPoints has a webpage for signing up and to distribution the schedule of matches
2. When you are added to the roster, the coordinator will send you the Member website URL.  Please bookmark this site. You will go to this site frequently to signup for dates, get the schedule of matches, and to see group announcements.  This URL should not be shared with non-Members.
3. The schedule of matches for the next month is published on the Member page the day after signup ends.
4. The current month and the prior month's schedules are alway available on the Member page of the group website.
5. For example, signup for the month of April typically ends about March 24 (dates vary slightly each month). The April schedule is published the next day, on March 25. This gives captains time to create the court requests for April 1 matches.

## Entering court requests in Chelsea and Captains responsibilities

1. Court requests need to be entered in Chelsea 3 days before the match date, for example, if a match on April 6, the REQUEST needs to be entered no later than April.
2. Chelsea issues court assignment 3 days prior to the match, on April 3. You are notified by email of court assignments.
3. Login to Chelsea and create a court REQUEST at least 4 days prior to the date of the match
4. Enter Court Time Info.We play Monday- Saturday 8 am North 8:00 AM North/South/Any. 11 a.m. is the latest time to put.

1. Your default roster email will be added to the MatchPoint Google Group: <matchpoint-tennis@googlegroups.com>
