7. When you fill out the signup form, if you do not receive an confirmation email within 60 seconds, you entered an invalid email (probably with a typo) and you should enter you dates again with the correct email address.
## Publishing the Schedule of Matches

2. When you are added to the roster, the coordinator will send you the Member website URL.  Please bookmark this site. You will go to this site frequently to signup for dates, get the schedule of matches, and to see group announcements.  This URL should not be shared with non-Members.
3. The schedule of matches for the next month is published on the Member page the day after signup ends.
4. The current month and the prior month's schedules are alway available on the Member page of the group website.
5. For example, signup for the month of April typically ends about March 24 (dates vary slightly each month). The April schedule is published the next day, on March 25. This gives captains time to create the court requests for April 1 matches. 
## Entering court requests in Chelsea and Captains responsibilities
